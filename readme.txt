Please note:
ðŸ”’In the 'Database Cleaning.sql' file we have a query that converts 'lastlogin' and 'timestamp' columns from text to timestamp.
ðŸ”’ This query is based on the format of the system's time. We have written it according to the format on our local machine and it might not work on every machine 
ðŸ”’Please change these two lines in the query according to the local machine's time format
SET TempLastLogin = STR_TO_DATE(`LastLogin`, '%Y-%m-%d');
SET TempTimestamp = STR_TO_DATE(`Timestamp`, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s');
